    <div id="content1" class="data-content">
      <p>The 2024 FSU IGEM team used statistical, electrochemical, and biological modeling to investigate the challenges posed by the design process with the aim of developing a new diagnostic tool inspired by FSU IGEM's therapeutic E. esperance. For this year‚Äôs project, we developed three key models to enhance different aspects of our research in designing a device capable of detecting trimethylamine (TMA) via breath analysis. The first model involves molecular docking, which we used to determine the binding affinity of TMA to specific enzymes, guiding the selection of enzymes that our engineered bacteria should express. The second model is an amperometric measurement, which enables the device to accurately measure TMA concentrations based on the collection of one‚Äôs breath. The third model encompasses the components of the device, which allows the TMA from the patient‚Äôs breath to be converted into a interpretable valuable. Building on these models, we developed a BioFET, which was inserted into an electrical device for patient use. This device provides output and visualization via LEDs, allowing for real-time monitoring of TMA levels.</p>

      <p> K<sub>M</sub> and V<sub>max</sub> are two key variables we considered when considering favorable enzyme kinetics for our modeling and experimental conditions. A challenge with TMA is that it is extremely small, non-polar, has steric hinderance and can only be detected in extremely low concentrations. Therefore, to maximize the detection of this molecule is have it interact with a specialized enzyme, human flavin-monooxygenase 3 (fmo3) or trimethyl monooxygenase (tmm), and measure it with a highly sensitive device. However, for the purpose of creating a reliable and efficient device for patients, not just any hfmo3 or tmm will be satisfactory. We strived to use an enzyme that has been proven to have a high binding affinity relative to enzyme and substrate concentration to ensure a higher and more accurate TMA measurement. In addition, the rate at which TMA binds with the enzyme and oxidizes was important to consider for how long it will take a patient to obtain the results of their test with our device. The Michaelis-Menten constant, K<sub>M</sub>, indicates the efficiency of an enzyme under different substrate concentrations (Ahern & Rajagopal). K<sub>M</sub> is inversely related to the affinity of the enzyme for its substrate. A low K<sub>M</sub> suggests a higher enzyme binding affinity, meaning less substrate is required to reach the half V<sub>max</sub>. Meanwhile, a high K<sub>M</sub> suggests a low enzyme binding affinity, indicating more substrate is required to reach the half V<sub>max</sub> (Ahern & Rajagopal). V<sub>max</sub> represents the maximum rate at which the enzyme catalyzes the reaction when the enzyme is fully saturated with the substrate (Ahern & Rajagopal) .

    <h2 class="data-section-title" onclick="toggleSection('content4')">Molecular Docking Simulation</h2>
    <div id="content4" class="data-content">
      <p>Molecular docking is a computational technique that predicts how a small molecule, or ligand, binds to larger biomolecules such as proteins, enzymes, or nucleic acids. The software used to simulate molecular docking included UCSF Chimera and Tamarind Bio. Additionally, built-in programs such as AutoDock Vina and Smina are algorithms that run molecular docking simulation and provide a score relative to how well a molecule is predicted to bind to a protein or enzyme (Skariyachan & Garka, 2018 ). The output after running the simulation is a scored based on binding affinity (kcal/mol), and the upper and lower bound RMSD, or root mean standard deviation (Koes et al, 2013). A greater negative value for binding affinity indicates a better predicted binding affinity, and a lower negative value indicates a lower predicted binding affinity, and the RMSD value is a measure of comparison between experimental and predicted structures (Koes et al, 2013). A lower RMSD represents that there is little difference between the conformation of structures and a greater RMSD value represents a greater difference between predicted and experimental structures (Koes et al, 2013). </p>

    <div id="content5" class="data-content">
      <p>To measure the concentration TMA, knowing the voltage potential of TMA in its oxidized state, TMAO, is necessary. This value is established by testing the minimum amount of voltage required for a single electron transfer in a redox reaction of TMA and the enzyme used to oxide TMA using cyclic voltammetry. For reference, we have obtained data from literature that determined that the standard potential cathodic and anodic peaks lie within ‚àí440¬±12 and ‚àí382¬±13 mV respectively (fig. 1)(Castrignan√≤ et al., 2010). Oxygen is consumed at the electrode at ‚Äì670mV in the presence of TMA and and hfmo3 (fig. 2) in the presence of TMA and hfmo3 (Castrignan√≤ et al., 2010). In addition, we have also obtained a calibration curve that proves a significant difference in potential response between TMA and a control group (fig. 3) depicting a linear increase of voltage fluctuation up to 60 ¬µmol of TMA (fig. 4) (Castrignan√≤ et al., 2010). With this information we can assume that smaller concentrations of TMA while using a similar experimental model will also exemplify a linear relationship giving clear implications of its impact on the voltage potential. </p>

      <p> Once the voltage potential of the experiment is established, steady state amperometry can used to measure how the current being applied by the potentiostat fluctuates in the presence of different TMA concentrations over a set period of time. The results of the fluctuations demonstrated through amperometry is imperative to understanding how our device should respond to different TMA concentration to enable a real-time monitoring experience that has been desired by current TMA patients. </p>

  <div id="content6" class="data-content">

    <p> To achieve the best chance of obtaining a real-time measurement of TMA, we used amperometry to test our TMA concentrations. Amperometry outputs an i-t graph which shows how the current density of the standard potential changes as different analyte concentrations are added to the solution being tested over time. With support from the data in literature, we can assume that a steady-state potential of ‚Äì670 mV is the threshold to achieve a linear response with the TMA concentrations and hfmo3 being used in this experiment (Castrignan√≤ et al., 2010). Every 30 seconds additional TMA was added to the solution having the total experiment last 3 minutes. This is to simulate the maximum time between patient samples if more TMA from the breath is needed to obtain a reading. The average change in the current density 4.09 ¬µA. </p>

      <p> The BIOFET sensor system consists of several key components that work together to detect trimethylamine (TMA).

The gate, which contains a polymer matrix embedded with our biological recognition element trimethylamine monooxygenase (Tmm), plays a crucial role in the detection process. When TMA binds to Tmm, this interaction modulates the current flowing through the BIOFET circuit. An oxide layer, typically made from silicon dioxide (SiO2), insulates the gate while still allowing voltage variations to influence the    current, making the sensor sensitive to TMA levels.<p/>

    <h2 class="data-section-title" onclick="toggleSection('content10')">Conclusions</h2>
    <div id="content10" class="data-content">
    <p>   The data derived from our predictive modeling could not be experimentally tested due to engineering challenges that we faced this cycle at this time. However, the data generated from our amperometry model suggests that there is a clear change and a positive correlation between the current density of a steady voltage potential and increasing concentrations of TMA. This is further supported by the results of the cyclic voltamettry tests of TMA provided by literature. Additionally, the concentration of TMA in our experiment is 3 orders of magnitude less than the amounts tested in literature. This is a reason as to why the current density of the y-axis on our i-t graph is much smaller than the values seen on the y-axis of the cyclic voltammograns. Nonetheless, these minuscule changes provide a lower threshold for our device to detect a significant change, which can prove to be beneficial in this case since the symptoms of TMAU are caused by trace amounts or slightly higher concentrations of TMA that can be picked up in the breath.
  
  Furthermore, The difference in enzyme efficiency between Roseovarius sp. 217 TMM and M. aminisulfidivorans TMM is primarily influenced by their Km‚Äã and Vmax  values. Roseovarius sp. 217 has a higher Km‚Äã, indicating a lower affinity for TMA, but a significantly higher Vmax‚Äã, meaning it can process TMA much more rapidly when concentrations are high. In contrast, M. aminisulfidivorans exhibits a lower Km, reflecting a greater affinity for TMA at lower concentrations, but its lower Vmax limits its catalytic activity. As a result, Roseovarius sp. 217 is more efficient overall, particularly at higher TMA concentrations, while M. aminisulfidivorans is more effective at binding TMA in low concentrations but less capable of rapid catalysis. Thus, Roseovarius sp. 217 proves to be the more efficient enzyme under typical conditions due to its greater catalytic turnover.

  
As a result, we can hypothesize that the Rosevarius sp. 217 will be the most efficient enzyme to react with TMA when considering the minimum potential needed for the redox reaction to occur due to having the greatest V<sub>max</sub> out of all of our enzymes. This would support a faster monitoring system as TMA will react quicker, and also indicate an increase in current density as more TMA is added to the solution.
  Lastly, we can hypothesize that M. aminisulfidivorans will be the most accurate enzyme for measuring TMA because of its extremely low K<sub>m</sub> value and its molecular docking score computed through the molecular docking simulation using autodock vina and smina, which showed to be the best among the rest of the enzymes.</p>

    <p>The device modeling proved beneficial as it helps our patients understand the type of product they can expect from our research. Externally, the handheld device is portable, discreet, and provides immediate feedback on their TMA levels. The electronic components were instrumental in outlining which parts will be used to create a functional device for the future.  </p>
