    <h2 class="data-section-title" onclick="toggleSection('content2')">The Problem Addressed</h2>
    <div id="content2" class="data-content">
      <p>Trimethylaminuria (TMAU), also known as Fish Odor Syndrome, is an Autosomal Recessive genetic disorder that burdens patients with an overpowering, stigmatizing odor, isolating them from society and taking a major toll on their mental health. The compound Trimethylamine (TMA) creates the fishy odor associated with TMAU. It accumulates in abnormally high concentrations in patients with TMAU because they cannot properly oxidize it into non-odorous trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) as unaffected people do. Being an ultra-rare disease, affecting a little over 800,000 people globally, the patient community often feels neglected and rejected, cultivating a deep feeling of hopelessness and on some occasions suicidal thoughts and ideation. There is a distinct lack of solutions for monitoring and managing symptoms creating a large gap in the market that our project addresses. Our goal in addressing TMAU is to provide hope, relief, and a better quality of life for individuals battling TMAU.</p> </p>Our team with EsperSense is developing a device to detect and monitor individuals' TMA concentrations. Despite the relatively low patient population of around 800,000 people worldwide, the high demand for monitoring presents us with an impactful initiative and a potentially high return. Our innovative solution, a breathalyzer leveraging a Biological Field Effect Transistor (Bio-FET) with a high-affinity receptor for TMA detection, offers a non-invasive method for monitoring and managing TMAU symptoms. We are also developing a mobile app companion to connect to the device and provide easily accessible and understandable symptom monitoring and analysis.</p> 
</p>Our decision to continue focusing on TMAU from the 2023 iGEM cycle was driven by a passion for helping the patient community battling this debilitating disorder. As mentioned in Human Practices* our monitoring device will ease the burden of TMAU and lessen its control on patients’ lives. By further engaging with our patient community and learning of their struggles we have grown even more motivated to bring our innovations to market and into their lives.</p> 
</p>We have already begun the process of bringing last year’s project, E. esperance, to market, with an overall plan of combining these two products to form a parent company called Esperance Healthcare. EsperSense will be used in tandem with the therapeutic to determine when and how much of the therapeutic should be used.</p>

    <h2 class="data-section-title" onclick="toggleSection('content4')">Product Description</h2>
    <div id="content4" class="data-content">
      <p>Our device is a convenient and ergonomic breathalyzer that can detect TMA concentration in exhaled breath—using a graphene Biological Field Effect Transistor integrated with a specifically chosen Trimethylamine Monooxygenase (Tmm) for TMA. These receptors possess a high binding affinity for TMA, allowing accurate detection through changes in electrostatic potential when TMA binds to the receptor. When a patient exhales into the device, TMA molecules in the breath interact with these receptors, causing a measurable change in the electrical current.

This change in current is then translated into a quantitative measurement of TMA concentration. By providing real-time TMA measurements, EsperSense empowers patients to track their symptoms, identify triggers, and make informed lifestyle choices to manage their condition.

Along with the breathalyzer is the companion app.
The key features of the app include:
TMA level tracking
Personalized Treatment Recommendations (Therapeutic Dosages)
Lifestyle Guidance (e.g. diet, exercise, and stress management)
Symptom Tracking
Trigger Identification
Progress Monitoring
Community Support


Lifestyle Guidance with EsperSense

In addition to monitoring TMA levels, EsperSense can also provide patients with valuable insights into lifestyle factors that may contribute to TMA production. By analyzing TMA data alongside patient-reported information about diet, exercise, and other lifestyle factors, EsperSense can identify potential triggers and offer personalized recommendations.


Diet Recommendations:

EsperSense can help patients identify foods that may exacerbate TMA production, such as red meat, beans, fish, and certain vegetables. Based on the identified triggers, patients can make informed dietary adjustments to reduce TMA levels.
Other Lifestyle Factors:

Regular exercise can help regulate metabolism and may have an indirect impact on TMA production. EsperSense can help patients track the effects of exercise on TMA levels. Stress can affect gut health and metabolism, potentially influencing TMA production. EsperSense can be used to monitor TMA levels during periods of stress and help patients develop effective stress management techniques. Some medications may interact with TMA metabolism. EsperSense can help patients identify potential interactions and make necessary adjustments to their medication regimen.

By providing personalized lifestyle guidance, EsperSense can empower patients to take a proactive approach to managing TMAU and improve their overall well-being.

    <div id="content3" class="data-content">
      <p>
The primary customer base of EsperSense and E. esperance are individuals diagnosed with Trimethylaminuria (TMAU). Since TMAU is “ultra rare” (as it has been described by industry experts) and there are presently no monitoring devices or successful treatments on the market, the annual revenue generated from the purchase of monitoring devices is not applicable. Therefore, the estimated market value is significantly untapped and undervalued.

Due to the chronic nature of TMAU and the persistent demand for symptom management and monitoring Esperance Healthcare is positioned as a viable venture. However, our primary mission is to enhance the quality of life for TMAU patients so we will strive to make our products as affordable and accessible as possible.

From the many interviews we conducted with TMAU patients, which can be found on our Human Practices Page, the overwhelming response is that they are willing to try any treatment that can help. With that in mind, we want to ensure that our products follow safety and government guidelines, along with both bioethical and ethical business practices to provide hope and trust for TMAU patients who use EsperSense and E. esperance.
